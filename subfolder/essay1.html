    <h1>When trying is an end in itself</h1>
    <p>Being content is typically understood to mean being replete, incurious or static. In fact, to be static is to be in a state of unrest.
To be content is to be in a state of perpetual pursuit. Children playing at war are content in their pursuit of victory, 
just as hounds following a scent are content in pursuit of their quarry. To be content is to be absorbed in the pursuit of a compelling goal.
    </p>
It's not the lack of change in your life that makes you feel content but pursuing a goal which remains constant despite changes in your circumstances or environment.
You are triumphant when you reach a particular goal but only for a short spell. The peace that comes from the certainty of pursuing an 
unchanging goal inevitably turns into disquiet when you finally get what you want. The goal disappears. When the certainty that comes from pursuing a goal has gone 
it leaves formless uncertainty. There is the prospect of unexpected loss, rejection, failure, physical and emotional pain and, at some unknown point, death. 
If you are in stasis you can only dread future disturbance. If you are absorbed in pursuit you either feel favourably about the future or do not think of the 
future at all.
    </p>
    <p> In order to recreate a state of contentment after a particular goal has been reached a new goal must be found. 
This is why people who achieve great things (athletes, engineers, artists, business-owners etc.) are quick to move on to new pursuits.
