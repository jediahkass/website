    <h1>When trying is an end in itself</h1>
    <p>Being content is typically understood to mean being replete, incurious or static. In fact, to be static is to be in a state of unrest.
To be content is to be in a state of perpetual pursuit. Children playing at war are content in their pursuit of victory, just as dogs following a scent are content in pursuit of their quarry. To be content is to be absorbed in the pursuit of a compelling goal.
    </p>
It's not the lack of change in life that creates contentment but the continued pursuit of a larger purpose which remains constant despite changes in  circumstances or environment. The triumph felt when a particular goal is reached is short-lived. The peace that comes from the certainty of pursuing an unchanging goal inevitably turns into disquiet that goal is reached. The object has been achieved and therefore is no longer an object. Purpose disappears. When the certainty that comes from pursuing a goal has gone 
it leaves a space of formless uncertainty. There is the prospect of unexpected loss, rejection, failure, physical and emotional pain and, at some unknown point, death. 
Stasis will inevitably be disturbed. Absroption in the pursuit of a larger purpose which has not yet been reached means that you either feel favourably about the future or are so absorbed that you do not think of the future at all.
    </p>
    <p> In order to recreate a state of contentment after a particular goal has been reached a new goal must be found. This is why people who achieve great things (athletes, engineers, artists, business-owners etc.) are quick to move on to new pursuits.
